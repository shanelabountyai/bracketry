# Progress

## L-003: round robin (2026-10-07)

**Built.** `gameKey` and `roundRobin` (circle method, last seat fixed, odd counts get a bye seat) in `src/lib/league/round-robin.ts`; `npm run league -- pairings --teams N [--legs 2]` prints rounds and byes. Suite renamed `.pending.ts` to `.test.ts`.

**Decided.** Spec §2 does not say which seat is fixed or which way the rest rotate; fixed = last seat, rotation by +1 per round. The suite and the spec's properties do not depend on it. Leg 2 is built by mirroring leg 1's home/away, round offset `m − 1`.

**Measured.** Red first: 77 tests, 77 NotImplementedError. Green: 77/77. Gate: lint 0 errors (19 warnings, all unused params in the remaining stubs), typecheck clean, 240 tests across 30 files, `foundation:drift` clean against v1.2.0. `pending:check` now covers 61 tests in five suites.

**Left behind.** Nothing.

## L-002: guard rails (2026-10-06)

**Built.** ESLint block scoped to `src/lib/league/**` banning `Math.random`, `Date.now`, argument-less `new Date()`, and imports from `@/core`, `@/app`, `@/modules` and Prisma (D-3). `scripts/league.ts` CLI skeleton (`npm run league -- <command>`, no commands yet). `npm run pending:check` runs the pending suites through `vitest.pending.config.ts` and prints, per suite, NotImplementedError vs other failures.

**Decided.** `new Date('2026-01-01')` is not banned by the rule (only the clock-reading no-arg form); D-6 still forbids it by convention. Pending suites run with no setup file, so they need no database.

**Measured.** `pending:check`: 138 tests, 133 NotImplementedError, 5 other failures (the "refusal" tests, which fail on their assertion). Per suite: bracket 17 (13/4), feasibility 5 (5/0), generate 15 (15/0), round-robin 77 (76/1), score 11 (11/0), standings 13 (13/0). Lint rule verified against a probe file: all five banned forms flagged, `new Date('...')` correctly not.

**Left behind.** Nothing. The CLI has no commands until L-003.
